      <span id="first" class="js">JavaScript</span> (/ˈdʒɑːvəˌskrɪpt/),[10] often abbreviatclass="js"ed as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification.[11] <span class="js">JavaScript</span> is high-level, often just-in-time compiled and multi-paradigm. It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation and first-class functions.

    Alongside <span>HTML</span> and <span>CSS</span>, <span class="js">JavaScript</span> is one of the core technologies of the World Wide Web.[12] Over 97% of websites use it client-side for web page behavior,[13] often incorporating third-party libraries.[14] All major web browsers have a dedicated <span class="js">JavaScript</span> engine to execute the code on <span style="font-weight:bold;color:red"> the user's device.</span>
